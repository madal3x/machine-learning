# machine-learning

Me going through the free online class
[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) taught by
[Andrew Ng](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ang/)
of [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu/).

## Disclaimer

This repository contains the solutions to all of the course's programming
exercises. If you're currently taking the course, I ask that you respect the
[Stanford Honor Code](#stanford-honor-code) and don't submit my solutions.

### Stanford Honor Code

> "We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the
> lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get
> together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the
> answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work.
> For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other
> students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we
> ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different
> student, nor show your solution code to other students."
